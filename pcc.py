Fixed:
 1. Graph was generating dictonaries with int and int64 numbers. 
 2. dict/list access was too slow, changed to matrix.
 3. Bug in GreedyWalk, probability vector was being normalized but
    the vector sum wasn't adjusted to 1.
 4. Particles' strength were kept in a int matrix.
 5. Node labels were kept in a float matrix.

Changes:
 1. Changed __genGraph() to use sklearn.neighbors, which chooses the most
    efficient method to find the neighbors (usually not brute force).
 2. Neirest Neighbors lists now use uint32 instead of the mix of int/int64.
 3. Neirest Neighbors list is now a matrix of uint32 instead of dic/list 
   (the matrix access is much more efficient).
 4. GreedyWalk now avoid loops (vectorization) and has some other tweaks
    to drammatically improve speed.
 5. Changed int type to uint8 in the distance table (saves memory space at
    a small computational cost, check comments)
 6. Changed the particle matrix into a particle class to fix the particle
    strength being held in a int type matrix. 
 7. Changed the nodes matrix into a nodes class to keep labels and dominance
    levels separated and with proper data types.
 8. Removed class_map to avoid unnecessary overhead (though it is small). 
    This kind of treatment could be reimplemented to be active only twice: 
    on input and on output.
 9. Eliminated the loop in the 'labeling the unlabeled nodes' step.
10. Added the early stop criteria.
11. Moved execution time evaluation to the example.
12. Vectorized the update() method and did some other tweaks to improve
    speed.
13. Moved the distance table to the particle attributes.
14. Changed fit/predict to a single fit_predict method, as it makes more sense
    for a transductive SSL method. graph_gen() is available as a separate
    function since one may want to run multiples executions with the same graph.
     
Note:
 1. Node dominances and particle strenght are using float64 because it is a
    little faster than float32, though we don't really need 64 bits precision
